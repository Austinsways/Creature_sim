# Overview

This is a basic neural network/creature simulation that creates an input generated amount of creatures holding random traits that have inputs and outputs.
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

* add graphics
* create traits to match trait ID's
* add multiple triat pathways and ability to add more neurons.
